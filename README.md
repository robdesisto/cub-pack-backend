# Cub Scout Pack API Proxy

The complimentary API proxy for the cub scout [client application](https://github.com/robdesisto/cub-pack-site). This little application is light-weight and 
written using [HapiJs](https://hapijs.com/). I will probably eventually port it to Typescript, because I do things like that. 

## Getting Started

Fork the project on Github and clone your version down.

Run: ```npm install```

Then: ```npm start``` to start the server.

To publish it, use ```npm run release``` which will trigger standard version, and push to Github.
